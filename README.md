# Simple Iris Flower Prediction

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://elliottfairhall-iris-flower-prediction-main-e0ikd7.streamlit.app/)

This project is a machine learning application for predicting the type of iris based on measurements of its petal and sepal length and width. Utilizing a combination of modules such as sklearn, numpy, and pandas, we train a model to accurately classify Irises into one of three species based on their physical characteristics. The project could prove to be a useful tool for botanists and other interested individuals to quickly and accurately identify different types of Irises.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed, as well as the following libraries:

-   pandas
-   scikit-learn
-   streamlit
-   Pillow

You can install these libraries using `pip`, for example:

shCopy code

`pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit Pillow` 

## Usage

To use this application, simply run the `main.py` file and open the URL that appears in the terminal.

`streamlit run main.py` 

The application will open in your default web browser, and you can interact with it by adjusting the input parameters using the sliders provided, then pressing the "Predict" button to see the model's prediction and prediction probability.

## Business Use

The Simple Iris Flower Prediction project could be used as a tool for botanists and other interested individuals to quickly and accurately identify different types of Irises. Additionally, the techniques and libraries used in this project could be applied to other classification problems in fields such as medicine, finance, and marketing, to name a few.
